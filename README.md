## Project Overview

Welcome to our GitHub repository for the Eye-Tracking Mouse and Keyboard Control project! 
This project was developed by a team of four participants during a national level hackathon (Kodicon 3.0). 
Our goal was to create a system that enables mouse and keyboard control through eye-tracking technology.

## Project Description

Our project focuses on utilizing eye-tracking technology to provide an alternative method for mouse and keyboard control. 
The system employs computer vision algorithms to track eye movements and translates them into corresponding mouse movements and keyboard inputs.

## Features

- **Real-time Eye Tracking**: The system continuously tracks the user's eye movements in real-time.
  
- **Mouse Control**: Translate eye movements into mouse cursor control for navigation.

- **Keyboard Control**: Implement eye gestures to simulate keyboard inputs.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV for computer vision
- Eye-tracking library (e.g., Tobii or similar)
- Java Script
- CSS
- HTML
